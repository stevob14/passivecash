Passive cash is cash that requires little to no effort to earn and maintain. If you are someone who wants fire(financial independence and early retirement), passive cash is what you want to focus on. In general, making cash with little to no effort to earn and maintain is primarily dependent on having cash to start with. I think it's important to break down your cash to the smallest value, a penny. From there, you can view every penny as an indivual worker that you employ. Overtime, these little "workers" can earn you passive cash even while you sleep. I have compiled a list of working methods in getting you one step closer to financial freedom.

### High Yield Savings Accounts

High yield savings accounts are online accounts that pay multitudes more than a standard savings account. Lets say you have $100 dollars that you would like to deposit to your traditional savings account. On average, a tradional savings account may offer a .09% interest rate. This means that in 12 months, your $100 is now equal to $100.09 (100 * .0009) + 100. Now lets say you invest this same $100 in a high yield savings account. As of 5/24/2020, the best interest rate is 1.75%. This is ~19 times the average interest rate offered at a tradional savings account. In 12 months, your $100 is now equal to $101.75 (100 * .0175) + 100. Please note, for simplicity, these calculations do not take into account compounding interest. Compounding interest is essentially interest on interest, or rather, the result of reinvesting the interest earned. Compounding interest can be compounded daily, monthly, quarterly, or anually. While this still seems small, remember what I said about breaking down your cash to the smallest value. Here is an updated [list](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/high-interest-savings-to-get/) of current high yield savings accounts. 

### Earn Interest on Crypto

Earning interest on cryptocurrency is a fairly new opportunity that can be compared to earning interest in a traditional bank. If you currently hold cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, you could be taking advantage of services that offer to pay you interest on your holdings. [Blockfi](https://blockfi.mxuy67.net/GWA46) is one such service. BlockFi lets you put your crypto to work and earn monthly interest payments in the cryptocurrency that you deposit with Blockfi. Most importantly, this interest is compounded. You can view the current rates [here](https://blockfi.com/rates)

### Earn Interest on Crypto (Alternative)

Some cryptocurrencies such as NEO and Tezos offer rewards for holding crypto in your wallet.

Holding NEO in a [wallet](https://neo.org/wallets) generates GAS. GAS is used to pay for smart contracts on the network. These fees are distributed to NEO holders as reward for their activity on the network. You can view the current Neo-to-Gas rates [here](https://neotogas.com/)

Tezos offers staking rewards. Staking is the process of holding funds in a crypto wallet to support the network and, in return, holders are rewarded for their activity on the network. An easy way to start earning rewards with Tezos is by visiting [Earn staking rewards on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/tezos)
