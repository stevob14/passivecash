Passive cash is cash that requires little to no effort to earn and maintain. If you are someone who wants to achieve FIRE(financial independence and early retirement), passive cash is what you want to focus on. 

In general, making cash with little to no effort to earn and maintain is primarily dependent on having cash to start with. A common misconception is thinking that you must have large amounts of cash to get started. I understand the more cash you have available to invest, the more you can potentially make; but it's helpful to break down your cash to the smallest value - a penny. From there, you can view every penny as an individual worker that you employ. Overtime, these little "workers" can earn you passive cash even while you sleep. I have compiled a list of working methods in getting you one step closer to financial freedom.

### High Yield Savings Accounts

High yield savings accounts are online accounts that pay multitudes more than a standard savings account. Lets say you have $100 dollars that you would like to deposit to a traditional savings account. On average, a traditional savings account may offer a .09% interest rate. This means that in 12 months, your $100 would be (100 * .0009) + 100 = $100.09. Now lets say you invest this same $100 in a high yield savings account. As of 5/24/2020, the best interest rate is 1.75%. This is ~19 times the average interest rate offered at a traditional savings account. In 12 months, your $100 would be (100 * .0175) + 100 = $101.75. 

Please note, for simplicity, these calculations do not take into account compounding interest. Compounding interest is essentially interest on interest, or rather, the result of reinvesting the interest earned. Compounding interest can be compounded daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. While these values seem small, keep in mind what I said about breaking down your cash to the smallest value. The more cash you have, the more you can make passively. Here is an updated [list](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/high-interest-savings-to-get/) of current high yield savings accounts. 

### Earn Interest on Crypto

Earning interest on cryptocurrency is a fairly new opportunity that can be compared to earning interest in a traditional bank. If you currently hold cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, you could be taking advantage of services that offer to pay you interest on your holdings. 

[Blockfi](https://blockfi.mxuy67.net/GWA46) is one such service. BlockFi lets you put your crypto to work and earn monthly interest payments in the cryptocurrency that you deposit with Blockfi. Most importantly, this interest is compounded. You can view the current rates [here](https://blockfi.com/rates).

### Earn Interest on Crypto (Alternative)

Some cryptocurrencies such as NEO and Tezos offer rewards for holding crypto in your wallet.

Holding NEO in a [wallet](https://neo.org/wallets) generates GAS. GAS is used to pay for smart contracts on the network. These fees are distributed to NEO holders as rewards for their activity on the network. You can view the current Neo-to-Gas rates [here](https://neotogas.com/).

Tezos offers staking rewards. Staking is the process of holding funds in a crypto wallet to support the network and, in return, holders are rewarded for their activity on the network. An easy way to start earning rewards with Tezos is by visiting [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/?r=5192f46085e1c325b800001d). Get free Bitcoin worth $10 when you sign up which you can then convert to Tezos to start earning passive cash. After registering, you can earn an additional $6 worth of Tezos by learning about Tezos at [Coinbase Earn Tezos](https://www.coinbase.com/earn/tezos). In total, that's $16 worth of Tezos to get you started. You can read more about staking on Coinbase [here](https://www.coinbase.com/staking).

### Dividends

Dividends are a great way to earn passive cash. A dividend is the distribution of a part of a company's earnings that is paid to its shareholders. Dividends are typically paid monthly, quarterly, or annually. Remember to take into consideration compounding. Monthly dividends compound quicker, and therefore, your shares accumulate at a faster rate if you were to reinvest the dividends.

Please be **cautious** when looking at the dividend yield. Generally, the higher the yield, the more risky it may be for you as a shareholder. Stocks that have a dividend yield greater than 10% can be seen as risky investments. Here is a list of [high dividend stocks by yield](https://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/high-dividend-yield-stocks/#tm=3-high-yield-stocks&r=Webpage%231281&f_35=true&f_9_min=2&f_9_max=100).

There are two types of dividends, qualified and non-qualified. Most regular dividends from corporations are qualified. One example of a non-qualified dividend is dividends paid out by REIT(real estate investment trusts). The main takeaway between the two are that qualified dividends are taxed at capital gains rate, and non-qualified dividends are taxed at a person's regular income tax rate. One core fundamental of investing in dividend paying funds is minimizing taxes. Lets take a look at Tax Brackets for 2020 to get a better understanding.

#### 2020 Single Filer Tax Brackets

Income Tax Bracket | Tax Rate | Capital Gains Rate
------------ | ------------- | -------------
**$0 - $9,875** | 10% | **0%**

$40,001 – $40,125 | 12% | 15%
$40,126 – $85,525 | 22% | 15%
$85,526 – $163,300 | 24% | 15%
$163,301 – $207,350 | 32% | 15%
$207,351 – $441,450 | 35% | 15%
$441,451 – $518,400 | 35% | 20%
$518,401+ | 37% | 20%

#### 2020 Joint Filer Tax Brackets

**$0 – $19,750** | 10% | **0%**
**$19,751 – $80,000** | 12% | **0%**

$414,701- $496,600 | 35% | 15%
$496,601 – $622,050 | 35% | 20%
$622,051+ | 37% | 20%

From this, you can see that individuals making <=$40,000 and joint couples making <=$80,000 are tax exempt from qualifying dividends. If you want to avoid dividend taxes altogether, investing in dividend paying stocks in a retirement account is the way to go. Retirement accounts such as a 401(k) and a Roth IRA are two such examples. Within these accounts, your dividends will grow tax free. If you were interested in investing in REIT funds, it may be ideal to hold these in a retirement account. However, there are some [advantages to holding REIT in a taxable account](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4158333-advantages-of-reits-in-taxable-account).

There are some exceptions. For example, Municipal bonds are typically exempt from federal taxation regardless of income. iShares National Muni Bond ETF(MUB) is one such ETF that has a yield of ~2.44% and pays monthly. VanEck Vectors High-Yield Municipal Index ETF(HYD) is another ETF that has a yield of ~4.66 and pays monthly.

Finally, if you're ready to get started in earning dividends; Robinhood offers users a platform to invest in stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies, all commission-free, right from your phone or desktop. In addition, Robinhood also offers fractional shares(ability to purchase a share like Amazon for as low as $1) as well as cash management(earn interest on your uninvested cash). Sign up at [Robinhood](https://share.robinhood.com/stephec1028) and we each receive a free stock valued between $3 and $150 - average is $10.
