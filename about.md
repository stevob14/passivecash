<h2>About</h2>
<h4 id= "advertisement"></h4>
I am a programmer, investor, and cryptocurrency enthusiast. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.G.S. with concentrations in Math, Organizational Leadership, and Kinesiology.

I enjoy researching ways to make passive cash and figured I could share the knowledge I obtain along the way.
